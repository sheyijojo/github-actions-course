## Use a workflow to publish to GitHub Packages
```yaml
GitHub Packages let you securely publish and consume packages,:
store your packages alongside your code,:
and share your packages privately with your team or publicly with the open-source community.:
You can also use GitHub Actions to automate your packages.:

Following is an example of a basic workflow that runs whenever a new release is created in a repository. If the tests pass, then the package is published to GitHub Packages.:

 A release typically comes before publishing a new package in workflows like the one you provided because GitHub Releases serve as a milestone or formal announcement for your project,
 while publishing a package is just one part of that milestone.
Here’s why this ordering makes sense:

Great question! A release typically comes before publishing a new package in workflows like the one you provided because **GitHub Releases** serve as a milestone or formal announcement for your project, while publishing a package is just one part of that milestone. Here’s why this ordering makes sense:

---

### **1. Releases Define a Version Milestone**
- A **GitHub Release**:
  - Represents a formalized version of your project (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - Includes release notes, changelogs, and other relevant details about the changes in the version.
  - Serves as a communication tool for users, letting them know about new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes.

**Example**:  
If you're introducing a new feature, you might want users to first understand the changes before interacting with your package. The release documentation provides that context.

---

### **2. Releases Trigger Automation**
- In workflows like yours:
  - A new release triggers automation (e.g., running tests, building artifacts, publishing the package).
  - The release event (`on: release: types: [created]`) acts as the central point for all subsequent actions.

This allows you to:
- Ensure the code tied to the release tag is thoroughly tested before publishing.
- Consistently associate published packages with a specific release version.

---

### **3. Publishing a Package is Just One Aspect of a Release**
Publishing the package is a subset of what a release entails. A release might also include:
- Source code downloads.
- Additional artifacts or binaries.
- Documentation updates.
- Deployment to other environments (e.g., staging, production).

By creating the release first, you provide a foundation for all these actions.

---

### **4. Improved Version Control and Traceability**
- Creating a release before publishing a package ensures that the published package can always be tied back to a specific Git tag and release.
- This enhances traceability, as users can:
  - Look at the release notes for details about the package.
  - Check out the exact code that produced the package.

---

### **5. Alternative Flow: Publishing a Package First**
You could reverse the flow by publishing the package first and creating the release afterward. This might make sense if:
- Your workflow is simpler and only focuses on the package without broader milestones.
- You don't need detailed release notes or multiple artifacts.

However, the current practice of creating a release first aligns well with **best practices for software versioning** and **GitHub's ecosystem**.

```yaml
name: Node.js Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  publish-gpr:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 12
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com/
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

```
>First, the workflow file must exist in the .github/workflows directory. It's common practice to name a workflow that publishes a new package whenever a new release is created something like release-package.yml, to make it easy for project collaborators to understand its purpose without navigating to the workflow file.

>The preceding workflow does a few things after a new release is created:

>A job named build runs npm ci ("ci" for Continuous Integration) to install dependencies directly from the package-lock.json file, as well as the tests for the project.
>Once the build job succeeds, the job named publish-gpr publishes the package.
>The workflow publishes the package to the registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com/ using an access token for authentication.
